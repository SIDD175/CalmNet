# CalmNet – Stopping Online Panic Before It Spreads

CalmNet is a student-built project focused on reducing online panic caused by misleading and emotionally harmful digital content.

Instead of checking whether a message is true or false, CalmNet focuses on understanding whether a message can create fear, panic, or conflict if it is shared.

## Problem Statement

Today, information spreads very fast through WhatsApp, social media, and online platforms. Many messages are forwarded without thinking. Some messages are not fully fake but are written in a way that creates fear, urgency, or anger.

Because of this:
- Panic spreads faster than facts  
- Rumors go viral  
- Small issues become serious real-world problems  

Most existing tools work after the damage is already done.

## Our Idea – CalmNet

CalmNet helps users pause and think before sharing content online.

Users paste a message or post into the app. CalmNet checks whether the message contains panic-creating elements such as urgency, fear words, emotional pressure, or sensitive topics.

Based on this, the app shows one of the following results:
- Safe to Share  
- Sensitive – Think Before Sharing  
- High Risk – May Create Panic or Conflict  

A short explanation is also shown so users understand the reason.
