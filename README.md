# CalmNet – Stopping Online Panic Before It Spreads

CalmNet is a student project created to deal with a very common problem we see every day on the internet – panic spreading through messages, forwards, and social media posts.

Many times, the content people share is not completely fake, but it is written in a way that creates fear, urgency, or anger. Once such messages start spreading, people react without thinking, and this can lead to confusion, panic, or even real-life problems.

CalmNet tries to stop this at an early stage.

## What Problem Are We Solving?

Today, information travels very fast through platforms like WhatsApp, Instagram, Telegram, and online news apps. People forward messages quickly, mostly without checking or thinking about the effect it can have on others.

Some common issues we noticed:
- Panic spreads faster than correct information  
- Emotional messages get shared more  
- Rumors create unnecessary fear  
- By the time fact-checking happens, the damage is already done  

The real issue is not just fake news, but **panic-driven sharing**.

## Our Idea – CalmNet

CalmNet is a simple tool that helps users think before sharing online content.

Instead of asking *“Is this message true or false?”*, CalmNet asks a different question:

**“Can this message create panic or conflict if it is shared?”**

Users paste a message, post, or forwarded text into the app. CalmNet checks the message for things like:
- Fear or panic words  
- Urgent language  
- Emotional pressure  
- Sensitive or disturbing topics  

Based on this, the app shows one of three results:
- **Safe to Share**  
- **Sensitive – Think Before Sharing**  
- **High Risk – May Create Panic or Conflict**

A short and easy explanation is also shown so users understand the reason.

The final choice is always left to the user. CalmNet does not block or force anything. It only helps users pause and think.

## Why CalmNet Is Different

- Encourages responsible sharing habits

The goal is to make the internet a little calmer.

Sometimes, all it takes is a pause before sharing.
